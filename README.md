Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model and analysis for my final nonlinear dynamics course project.


About
-----
For my final project in my nonlinear dyanmics course, I programmed the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model. 
I explored the parameter space to identify the dynamical behavior. 
The .docx details the model and analysis, along with figures demonstrating different behaviors.
